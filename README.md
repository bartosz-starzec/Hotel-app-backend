# Hotel app backend
Simple Node.js backend application handling database operations and storing data for my hotel application.

I created this app to learn Node.js, especially:
- creating server
- handling requests
- managing database

Front end project for this app can be found here: https://github.com/harleyowiec/Hotel-app-front-end
